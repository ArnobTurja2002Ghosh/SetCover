There are 3 python files submitted in Assignment 1 for question 1:
read.py
SETTREE.py
system.py

Please ensure that all the three files are located in the same directory as the item-subset set files.
However, the main function of the assignment is in system.py

How to see the output of these three files?
Please open terminal and change directory (if necessary) to the location of the three files.
The format of the command line: python system.py <set-file>
If you do not specify the name of the item-subset set file and just command python system.py then you will be reminded about the proper format shown in the above line.

EASTER EGG:
You can see the output for multiple item-subset set files using only one command line.
Let us say you have all the data-set files, provided for this assignment by the professor, in the same directory as my three python files.
In the command line simply type (or just copy-paste):
python system.py iset1.txt iset2.txt iset3.txt iset4.txt iset5.txt iset6.txt iset7.txt iset8.txt
